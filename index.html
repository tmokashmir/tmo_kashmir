                For free collaborations, TMO Kashmir expects mutual benefits, such as exposure or content creation. 
                Our team will not tolerate misuse of the platform or attempts to exploit free collaborations for personal gain.

            <h4>5. Termination</h4>
            <p>
                TMO Kashmir reserves the right to terminate any collaboration or promotion without notice if the terms are violated or 
                if the content is deemed inappropriate, offensive, or against our platform's ethics.
            </p>
